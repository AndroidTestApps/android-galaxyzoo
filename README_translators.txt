*** Translating the app

To translate this app to your language, you need to provide translated versions of these files:
https://github.com/murraycu/android-galaxyzoo/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
https://github.com/murraycu/android-galaxyzoo/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/arrays.xml

For instance, here is the German translation:
https://github.com/murraycu/android-galaxyzoo/tree/master/app/src/main/res/values-de

You could submit them as a github pull request, or just email them if you find that too difficult.


There are some sample screenshots here to help you to understand the context:

*** Translating the website, to complete the app translation

The questions are not in the app itself. You can provide a translation of the Galaxy Zoo website that the app will then use.
For instance:
https://github.com/zooniverse/Galaxy-Zoo/tree/master/public/locales
From those files, we use the translations of the "Decision Tree":
https://github.com/zooniverse/Galaxy-Zoo/blob/master/app/lib/sloan_tree.coffee

Even if your language already has a translation of the website/decision-tree, you might look at that translation to decide what terminology to use when translating the app.


TODO: Robert Simpson says they are using some online tool for this that he can give people access to.

Many thanks for all your help.
