        <title>Shape</title>
        <text>Is the galaxy simply smooth and rounded, with no sign of a disk?</text>
        <help>The aim here is to divide featureless galaxies from all the rest. If you can see any interesting features at all, click &amp;quot;features or disk.&amp;quot; Just occasionally you might see something that isn't a galaxy at all - the long streak of a satellite, for example, or a image swamped by light from a bright star. If this happens, just click &amp;quot;star or artifact&amp;quot;. Click to see larger images.</help>

        <title>Disk</title>
        <text>Could this be a disk viewed edge-on?</text>
        <help>Disc galaxies are very thin, so look different when viewed from the side. We're trying to find exactly edge-on galaxies with this question. If the galaxy looks needle-like, perhaps with a bulge at the centre, then click &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; otherwise choose &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; (even for galaxies almost edge-on).
